# Machine-Learning
-------------------
I will share how to cartoonify an image using python and machine learning: ....

I used Opencv, matplotlib packages to process the image and plot it.

I used easygui and sys modules to open the file box.

I used os and tkinter libraries to read the path and save the image to that path.

# The steps
------------
First, we created the main window and file box and make the cartooning button in the main window. 

Second, read the image and scale its colour to grayscale, then smooth the grayscale of the image. 

Third, retrieve and adjust the edge of the image, then prepare the mask image and change some colours to give the image a cartoon effect. 

In the last step, we plot the image with all of its effects.
